        <h2>Club Rules</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Be kind to others. This is a safe space and we expect everyone to be civil
            and respect each other.
          </li>
          <li>The DM's word is final. If you have any issues with a ruling, speak to 
            them afterwords so games don't get de-railed over rule discrepancies.
          </li>
          <li>Keep conversations during games to a minimum. It's great that people 
            are getting along and socialising but everyone else shoudln't be held up 
            waiting for you to finish your conversation. That's what "Social Saturdays" are for!
